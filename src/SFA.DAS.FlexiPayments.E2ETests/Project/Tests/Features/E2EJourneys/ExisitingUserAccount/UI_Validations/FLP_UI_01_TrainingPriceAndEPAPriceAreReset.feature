Feature: FLP_UI_01_TrainingPriceAndEPAPriceAreReset

The purpose of this test is to perform UI validations in the below workflow:
- Training Provider adds a learner's details and send them to the employer 
- Employer reviews the details and suggests a different Total price; sends back the details to TP for approval
- When TP review the details, Total price suggested by Employer is displayed but Training Price and EPA price are reset 
- TP is unable to approve the cohort until they enter Training Price and EPA price
